Each directory corresponds to different symmetry imposed on the solution:
-dirhbs: spherical nuclei
-dirhbz: deformed nuclei with axial symmetry
-dirhbt: deformed triaxial nuclei  

The user should compile the code with "make" and run it with command "./run".

The input file, either DD-PC1 or DD-ME2, is determined by the value of the 
"Force" field in the "dirhb.dat" file.
Examples of "dirhb.dat" files for each case can be found in the "compareout-..."
directories as can the expected results.
